        <div id = "topHR"></div>
        <p>
        Each state has its own unique formula for funding elementary and secondary education, but nearly every state provides money based on an interaction of state- and district-generated dollars. This interactive shows the most common models adopted by states for providing school district funding. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Local dollars typically come from district-level property taxes, but states may also consider district income levels or other criteria when judging how much a district could contribute. In most cases, the local contribution is defined in terms of dollars per pupil.
        </p>
      </div>
    <div id='sections'>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Foundation Grants</div>
        <p>
        The most popular model for school funding is the foundation grant. A state decides how much should be spent, at minimum, per pupil, and estimates each district’s ability to pay. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In this example, the state sets a minimum of $10,000 per pupil, and estimates how much each district could pay using a 1 percent tax.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        Based on this amount, the state provides funding up to the minimum spending amount. In some cases, districts may not get any foundation funding, because they can meet (or exceed) the spending minimum on their own.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>In most foundation formulas, the state requires a minimum spending level, but states may spend a higher amount if they wish. In this example, districts are required to tax at a minimum of 1% of property wealth, but can opt to tax up to 1.20%.
        </p>
        <p>
        When districts have leeway to choose their own property tax rate, some districts elect to tax at a higher rate, creating some inequality among districts. However, because the state guarantees a high minimum foundation, differences between districts are relatively small.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        This type of funding requires a high level of commitment from the state. If states decide to decrease their contributions or if contributions don’t increase with inflation, districts may opt to increase their spending. Because property-wealthy districts can raise more by increasing the property tax rate, differences between districts can quickly increase, even if every district raises their spending to the 1.2% rate.
        </p>        
      </section>
      <section class="step">
      <div class="title">Power Equalization</div>
        <p>
        Because districts have unequal access to property wealth, foundation grants must be relatively large to minimize differences in spending among districts. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To help districts that have low property wealth, some states have opted to use a power equalization or guaranteed tax base model, where districts are guaranteed a minimum amount of money for their tax effort.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this example, the state determines that each district should be guaranteed $6,000 per pupil per 1 percent tax. 
        </p>
        <p>
        When every district taxes at 1 percent, this looks similar to the foundation aid model. 
        </p>
        <p>
        However, districts that could previously only raise small amounts of revenue from its tax base can now raise substantially more with a “match” from the state. Districts with lower property wealth now have an incentive to raise local taxes, since each additional dollar of local spending will yield more money from the state. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step smallStep">
        <p>
        In both the foundation and power equalization models, some districts do not receive any state aid because their property wealth per pupil is higher than the minimum level established by the state.
        </p>
        <p>
        Some states choose to “recapture” this spending through a cap on spending for these districts. For example, in our power equalization model, we can state that any funds raised above $6,000 per 1% recaptured by the state. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        In any state funding model, there’s a risk to using recapture.  Living in a high-wealth district may be associated with preferences for high spending on education. Under recapture, additional dollars in property taxes would not go to local students, and property values in the district may decline as a result. If the state relies on recapture to fund redistribution to property-poor districts, it may lower the recapture threshold, causing a spiral of decreasing property values.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        SECOND STEP OF DEATH SPIRAL
        </p>
        <p>
        Because power equalization formulas can dramatically change incentives for districts, states that use a power equalization model typically use it in combination with a foundation grant, matching dollars spent above a minimum amount.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
      <div class="title">Centralized School Finance</div>
        <p>
         So far, we’ve seen that states can either guarantee a minimum level of adequate spending or guarantee a minimum tax base for property-poor districts. In each case, districts have some leeway to choose property tax rates to in order to raise required local funding.
        </p>
        <p>
        Some states have opted for a different path. Rather than trying to outspend rich districts or equalize property values, these states have centralized their school finance system. The state assigns a standard property tax rate for all districts. In return, it guarantees roughly the same per pupil amount across districts.
        </p>
        <p>
        In practice, this model is like a foundation grant, but the district has no leeway to raise funds above the minimum amount for current expenditures.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this example, the state sets a standard payment $10,000 per pupil, and each district pays a 1 percent tax. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Just as in other examples, states may have to decide how to treat districts that can raise more than the standard payment using a 1% tax. The state could allow the district to keep the money (under what is sometimes called a “hold harmless” provision) or the state could recapture the additional funds.

                      We measured the progressivity of school funding as the difference between two weighted averages of each district&rsquo;s per-student revenue: (1) weights are the number of poor students; and (2) weights are the number of nonpoor students. For example, an estimate of $100 would imply that, on average, poor students attend districts that receive $100 more in per-student funding than the districts nonpoor students attend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We calculated our measure for nearly all regular US school districts using data on federal, state, and local revenues from the US Department of Education&rsquo;s Common Core of Data Local Education Agency Finance Survey (F-33). We merged the finance data with district-level poverty data from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Model-based Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates.  We adjusted districts&rsquo; funding amounts for differences in the costs they face using a measure of the salaries of college graduates who are not teachers in the district&rsquo;s labor market.
